# PropFlow HTTP API

The contract for every endpoint that exists today: the milestone-3 slice (auth, session, work,
assignment, bulk vendor, reference data, saved views), the milestone-4 communications surfaces
(residents, templates, the other bulk work actions), the milestone-5 automation rules, the
milestone-6 API-only surfaces (assets, global search, integrations) and the milestone-7
attachment storage. Section headings name the milestone each group came from.

Use HTTPS and retain cookies. API responses are JSON except successful 204s and the minimal readiness endpoint. API session/data responses use Cache-Control: no-store. Authentication failures return 401, authorization failures return 403; no HTML login redirects are used.

Login body:

```json
{
  "organizationSlug": "<organization slug printed during provisioning>",
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "password": "<your private password>"
}
```

Fetch a CSRF token before login, send it in X-CSRF-TOKEN, then fetch a fresh token after login. Anonymous tokens cannot authorize authenticated writes. Tokens are bound to the antiforgery cookie and current identity.

Enums serialize as their names everywhere in the API — a single `JsonStringEnumConverter` is
registered globally (`src/PropFlow.Api/Program.cs:68-69`) — so a work status is `"InProgress"`,
not `4`.

### Work list

`GET /api/work/` accepts these query-string parameters, all optional:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `search` | case-insensitive substring over title and description |
| `categoryId`, `propertyId`, `spaceId` | exact GUID filters |
| `status` | one of `Draft`, `New`, `Assigned`, `Scheduled`, `InProgress`, `OnHold`, `Completed`, `Cancelled` |
| `priority` | one of `Low`, `Normal`, `High`, `Critical` |
| `sort` | `title` (default), `status`, `priority`, `dueDate` (`due` is an accepted alias), `created`; matching is case-insensitive and an unrecognized value falls back to `title` |
| `descending` | `true` reverses the sort; default `false` |
| `page` | 1-based; values below 1 are clamped to 1. Default 1 |
| `pageSize` | clamped to 1–100. Default 25 |

Every sort breaks ties on ID, so paging is stable. The response is a page of **flat** work
objects — not the entity graph — each carrying its own concurrency token:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "…", "title": "Pest inspection", "description": "Seeded demo work item",
      "status": "New", "priority": "Normal", "workType": "WorkOrder",
      "propertyId": "…", "propertyName": "Harbor View",
      "buildingId": "…", "spaceId": "…",
      "categoryId": "…", "categoryName": "Pest control",
      "vendorId": null, "vendorName": null, "employeeId": null,
      "dueDate": "2026-09-12T09:00:00+00:00", "createdAt": "2026-09-09T13:45:00+00:00",
      "version": 12345
    }
  ],
  "totalCount": 12, "page": 1, "pageSize": 25
}
```

`totalCount` is the count before paging. `GET /api/work/{id}` keeps its own shape,
`{ "item": <full work record>, "version": <uint> }`.

### Work create and update

`POST /api/work/` takes `title` and `propertyId` (both required) plus the optional
`description`, `workType`, `categoryId`, `priority`, `buildingId`, `spaceId`, `residentId`,
`assetId`, `dueDate`, `cost`, `internalNotes`, `residentVisibleNotes` and `customFields`. The
item is created and published in one step, so it comes back in `New` status with a `createdAt`,
and a `WorkCreated` timeline entry is written in the same transaction. An empty or
unknown/foreign `propertyId` returns 400 and 404 respectively; a domain-invariant violation
(title length, negative cost) returns 400. An unknown/foreign `buildingId` / `spaceId` /
`categoryId` / `residentId` / `assetId` returns 400, as does an `assetId` for an asset at a
different property.

`PUT /api/work/{id}` replaces the editable fields (including `assetId` — `null` clears the link)
and requires the `version` read from a previous response. It also accepts an optional `status`
and `scheduledStart`/`scheduledEnd`; a status change goes through the domain state machine, so
moving out of `Completed`/`Cancelled` or back to `Draft` is rejected with 400, and scheduling
without a vendor or employee is rejected with 400. Title, priority, status, schedule and asset
changes each append their own timeline entry (`WorkUpdated`, `PriorityChanged`, `StatusChanged`,
`Scheduled`, `AssetLinked`). A stale `version` returns 409 and requires a reload.

`customFields` (create and update, FS-S03.02) is `{ "<definition key>": "<value>" | null }`,
keyed by a [custom field definition](#custom-field-definitions-fs-s0301)'s `key`, not its id.
Every value is validated against the live definition (type, `SingleSelect` option membership,
required-ness) before anything is written; an unrecognized key, an archived definition, or a
value the definition rejects returns 400 and applies nothing — not even the rest of the same
request's custom fields, and not the work item's own edits. A `null` (or blank) value clears any
existing value for that key rather than storing an empty one. Both endpoints and `GET
/api/work/{id}` echo the current set back as `customFields` on the response, keyed the same way.

`displayNumber` (FS-S03.04) is read-only — assigned automatically at creation if the
organization has [configured numbering](#numbering-fs-s0304) for `WorkItem`, `null` otherwise.
It appears on the work list, the work detail response, and the create/update responses; a caller
cannot set or change it.

`GET /api/work/{id}/timeline` returns entries oldest first, all one shape:
`{ id, eventType, occurredAt, actorId, oldValue, newValue, relatedObjectType, relatedObjectId,
changes, residentVisible }`. `eventType` is the event name (`WorkCreated`, `WorkUpdated`,
`VendorAssigned`, `EmployeeAssigned`, `StatusChanged`, `PriorityChanged`, `Scheduled`,
`AssetLinked`, `WorkNote`, `WorkReopened`, and the communication events `MessageQueued` /
`MessageSent` / `MessageFailed`); `oldValue` / `newValue` are the human-readable before/after
(a name, a status, an id); `changes` is a JSON
object with the details. `residentVisible` is `false` for work-history events and `true` for a
resident communication. Communication entries are folded in from the outbox on read — there is
no separate write — so a `MessageQueued` entry becomes `MessageSent` in place once the
dispatcher delivers it.

There are no event-specific fields — in particular no `vendorId` / `previousVendorId`; a vendor
assignment reports the vendor through `newValue` and `changes` like every other event. `actorId`
is null for a system-generated entry. A stored entry is included whether it carries the work
item in its own `WorkId` **or** references it through `relatedObjectType: "WorkItem"` +
`relatedObjectId`, so an entry with no `WorkId` of its own still appears on the work item's
timeline.

`POST /api/work/{id}/message` (`Communications.SendMessage` + CSRF) queues a resident message
about the work item: body `{ "templateId": "<guid>" }`. It resolves the work item's resident,
checks per-channel consent, renders the template's subject/body against
`resident.name` / `work.title` / `work.status` / `property.name` / `schedule.start` /
`schedule.end` (the two schedule values in the property's IANA time zone, `""` when the item is
not scheduled) and `note.text` (the note body when the message was enqueued by a `WorkNoteAdded`
rule, `""` here), and enqueues on the template's channel. 202 with `{ "queued": true }` on
success; 404 for an unknown work item or template; 409 when the work item has no resident, the
template is inactive, or the resident has not consented to that channel; 400 for a template
placeholder with no value or a control character reaching a rendered subject. The same template
sent to the same work item twice within an hour is de-duplicated (the template implies the
channel) — `{ "queued": false }`, 202, nothing enqueued.

### Assignment

Vendor assignment body — `version` is optional on the single-item route and omitting it skips
the concurrency check:

```json
{ "vendorId": "<vendor GUID>", "version": 12345 }
```

Employee assignment (`POST /api/work/{id}/employee`) takes the same shape with `employeeId`,
and requires the `Work.AssignEmployee` capability.

Success is `{ "changed": true }`; repeating the same assignment returns `{ "changed": false }` and creates no duplicate timeline entry. Unknown work/vendor/employee IDs, including other organizations' IDs, return 404. Invalid IDs return 400. A database concurrency conflict returns 409 and requires a reload. Assigning a vendor or employee to work in `New` moves it to `Assigned`; any other status is left alone. Tenant, actor and permissions come only from the session; extra JSON fields, query strings and tenant headers cannot override them.

**Terminal work takes no assignment, edit, status change or schedule.** Work in `Completed` or
`Cancelled` returns 400, and nothing is written, for the vendor route, the employee route, the
`PUT`, and every bulk route. The **only** way out of a terminal state is `POST
/api/work/bulk/reopen` (see below). Repeating an assignment that a work item already carries is
still `{ "changed": false }` rather than a 400, so replaying a completed action is not an error.

`POST /api/work/bulk/vendor` applies one vendor to a bounded batch:

```json
{ "vendorId": "<vendor GUID>", "items": [ { "workId": "…", "version": 12345 } ] }
```

`items` must hold 1 to 100 entries with distinct `workId`s; anything else is 400 (empty/oversized
batch) or 404 (duplicate IDs). The batch runs in one transaction: a stale `version` on **any**
item returns 409 and writes nothing at all, and an unknown work item or vendor returns 404 and
writes nothing. On success the response is a summary — `{ "changed": <int>, "unchanged": <int>,
"total": <int> }` — where `unchanged` counts items that already held that vendor. One timeline
entry is appended per item that actually changed.

### Other bulk work actions (PF-4.07)

`POST /api/work/bulk/{status|priority|schedule|note|reopen}` follow the same envelope and rules
as `bulk/vendor` — `items` is 1–100 entries with distinct `workId`s, one transaction, a stale
`version` on any item is a 409 that writes nothing, and the response is the same
`{ changed, unchanged, total }` summary. All five need `Work.Update`.

| Route | Body (besides `items`) | Item must be | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bulk/status` | `"status": "<WorkStatus>"` | not terminal | `Draft` target is 400; an item already in that status counts as `unchanged` |
| `bulk/priority` | `"priority": "<WorkPriority>"` | not terminal | a same-priority item counts as `unchanged` |
| `bulk/schedule` | `"scheduledStart"`, optional `"scheduledEnd"` | not terminal **and** have a vendor or employee | `end` before `start` is 400; moves each item to `Scheduled` |
| `bulk/note` | `"note"` (1–2000 chars), optional `"internal": true` | any (including terminal) | appends a `WorkNote` timeline entry carrying the text and `internal`/`resident` visibility; a resident-visible note fires the `WorkNoteAdded` automation trigger |
| `bulk/reopen` | — | **all** completed or cancelled | moves each back to `Assigned` (if it has an assignee) or `New`, clears `completedAt`, writes a `WorkReopened` entry — the only sanctioned exit from a terminal state |

A batch that mixes assignable and non-assignable items is refused whole with a 400 whose title
names the requirement; nothing is written.

`add tag` from the original PF-4.07 list is not shipped — the tag model / vocabulary is still an
open product question (`docs/backlog.md`).

### Saved views

A saved view is scoped to the organization **and** to the calling user: the list, read, update
and delete routes only ever see the caller's own rows, so another user's view ID returns 404.
The body is `{ "name", "filters", "columns", "isDefault" }`, where `filters` and `columns` are
arbitrary JSON values the client defines (they are stored verbatim and validated only as
well-formed JSON; a name outside 1–100 characters or malformed JSON returns 400). Setting
`isDefault` on a view clears the flag on the caller's other views, so at most one default
exists per user. Listing returns the default first, then the rest by name.

### Attachments (PF-7.01)

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/work/{workId}/attachments | `Work.Read`; the work item's files, newest first; `{ id, fileName, contentType, length, residentVisible, createdAt, retainUntil }` |
| GET | /api/work/{workId}/attachments/{id} | `Work.Read`; streams the file with its original name and content type, or 404 |
| POST | /api/work/{workId}/attachments | `Work.ManageAttachments` + CSRF; `multipart/form-data` with `file` (required), `residentVisible` (`true`/`false`, default false), `retainUntil` (optional future timestamp); 201 with the record |
| DELETE | /api/work/{workId}/attachments/{id} | `Work.ManageAttachments` + CSRF; removes the row and the stored blob; 204 or 404 |

Uploads are capped at 25 MB and limited to `application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`,
`image/webp`, `image/heic` (a larger file is 413, a wrong type 400). Every route resolves the
work item through the tenant filter and then the field-role scope check, so a Technician only
sees and manages the attachments on their own assigned work. `Work.ManageAttachments` is granted
to Organization Admin, Property Manager, Regional Manager, Maintenance Supervisor, and a bound
Technician. `retainUntil` is an opt-in expiry: a background sweep deletes an attachment (row and
blob) once that time passes; a null retention never expires.

There is no public registration endpoint. Use the administrative bootstrap command to create the first organization and account. The `seed-demo` command populates two organizations with a property hierarchy, vendor, employee, categories and work covering every status and priority (see [local development](local-development.md)).

Application errors use Problem Details with a request trace ID; unexpected details stay in server logs. Routing/authentication 401/403/404 and readiness responses may be empty/plain-text. Never log passwords, cookies or connection strings. OpenAPI documents endpoint shapes; these CSRF and capability requirements also apply even where generated metadata does not express them.

## Communications (milestone 4, in progress)

Enums serialize as their names (for example `"Sms"`, `"Email"`, `"Pending"`).

| GET | /api/residents | `Work.Read`; up to 200 tenant-scoped residents ordered by name |
| GET | /api/residents/directory | `Work.Read`; searchable tenant-scoped directory projection (up to 500) with `q`, `propertyId`, `buildingId`, `floor`, `room`, `status`, move-in, notice, and lease-expiration date filters; contact fields are masked without `People.Manage` |
| GET | /api/residents/directory/{id} | `Work.Read`; consolidated resident profile with masked contact fields, occupancy, lease, household, and linked-work context; records a `SensitiveResidentProfileViewed` audit entry |
| GET | /api/residents/{id} | `Work.Read`; one resident (name, email, phone, per-channel consent), or 404 including foreign-tenant IDs |
| GET | /api/residents/{id}/occupancies | `Work.Read`; the resident's occupancies (space, move-in/out dates) newest first, or 404 |
| POST | /api/residents | `People.Manage` + CSRF; `fullName`, `email`, `phone`; 201, 400 on invalid contact text |
| PUT | /api/residents/{id} | `People.Manage` + CSRF; `fullName`, `email`, `phone`; 200, 400, or 404 |
| PUT | /api/residents/{id}/consent | `People.Manage` + CSRF; `channel` (`Sms`/`Email`), `granted` (bool); records the decision with a server timestamp; 200 or 404 |
| POST | /api/residents/{id}/occupancies | `People.Manage` + CSRF; `spaceId`, `movedInOn` (`date`); 201, 400 for an unknown/foreign space, or 404 |
| PUT | /api/residents/{id}/occupancies/{occupancyId}/end | `People.Manage` + CSRF; `movedOutOn` (`date`); 200, 400 if it precedes move-in, or 404 |

A resident carries `smsConsent` / `emailConsent` (`Unknown` / `Granted` / `Revoked`) with the
decision timestamp. A message is only sent on a channel with an explicit `Granted` and a
matching address. Occupancy dates are `date` values; the current occupancy has no move-out
date. `People.Manage` is granted to Organization Admin and Property Manager. Contact fields
reject control characters (a resident name is a template substitution value).

### Assets

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/assets | `Work.Read`; up to 500 tenant-scoped assets ordered by name; optional `?propertyId=` filter |
| GET | /api/assets/{id} | `Work.Read`; one asset, or 404 including foreign-tenant IDs |
| GET | /api/assets/{id}/history | `Work.Read`; the asset plus every work item linked to it (newest first) and the roll-ups — `{ asset, ageInYears, underWarranty, workOrderCount, totalCost, history: [{ id, title, status, priority, categoryName, vendorName, createdAt, completedAt, cost }] }`; 404 for an unknown or foreign asset |
| POST | /api/assets | `Assets.Manage` + CSRF; `kind`, `name`, `propertyId`, `spaceId`, and the optional make/model/serial, `installedOn`/`warrantyExpiresOn`/`expectedServiceLifeYears`, `condition`, `replacementCostEstimate`, `notes`; 201, 400 for invalid text / a warranty before installation / a foreign or unknown property or space |
| PUT | /api/assets/{id} | `Assets.Manage` + CSRF; same body; the property and space are fixed at creation; 200, 400, or 404 |
| GET | /api/assets/repeat-repair-policy | `Work.Read`; the organization's repeat-repair thresholds — `{ repairThreshold, windowDays, matchByCategory }`; returns the defaults (`3`, `120`, `false`) until one is set |
| PUT | /api/assets/repeat-repair-policy | `Assets.Manage` + CSRF; upserts the single per-org policy; `repairThreshold` 2–50, `windowDays` 7–3650; 200 with the saved policy, or 400 out of range |
| GET | /api/assets/{id}/repeat-repair | `Work.Read`; assess one asset against the current policy — `{ repairThreshold, windowDays, matchByCategory, repairCount, since, totalCostInWindow, ageInYears, isRepeatRepair }`; counts published work linked to the asset with `createdAt` within the window; optional `?categoryId=` narrows the count to matching work when `matchByCategory` is on; 404 for an unknown or foreign asset |

`kind` is one of `Hvac`, `WaterHeater`, `Appliance`, `Roof`, `ElectricalPanel`,
`PlumbingFixture`, `Generator`, `Other`; `condition` is `Unknown`/`New`/`Good`/`Fair`/`Poor`/
`EndOfLife`. Dates are `date` values; `replacementCostEstimate` is money rounded to cents.
`Assets.Manage` is granted to Organization Admin, Property Manager, Regional Manager and
Maintenance Supervisor.

### Templates

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/communication/templates | `Communications.ManageTemplates`; tenant-scoped message templates ordered by name |
| GET | /api/communication/templates/{id} | `Communications.ManageTemplates`; one template, or 404 |
| POST | /api/communication/templates | `Communications.ManageTemplates` + CSRF; `name`, `channel` (`Sms`/`Email`), `subject` (required for email, rejected for SMS), `body` (may contain `{{ placeholder }}` tokens); 201 with the template, 400 on invalid content |
| PUT | /api/communication/templates/{id} | `Communications.ManageTemplates` + CSRF; `name`, `subject`, `body`, `isActive`; the channel is immutable; 200, 400, or 404 |
| DELETE | /api/communication/templates/{id} | `Communications.ManageTemplates` + CSRF; 204 or 404 |

`Communications.ManageTemplates` is granted to Organization Admin and Property Manager only.

The transactional outbox and its dispatcher are internal: messages are enqueued in the tenant
transaction that produces them, then delivered out of band by a background worker that polls
each organization on its own tenant context. Milestone 4 ships mock SMS and email providers
that record rather than send. No HTTP endpoint enqueues resident messages yet; that arrives
with the work-event wiring in a later task.

Dispatcher behavior is configured under `Communications` (`PollInterval`, `RetryDelay`,
`MaxDeliveryAttempts`, `StaleClaimTimeout`); defaults suit a single instance with mock
providers.

## Automation rules (milestone 5)

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/automation/rules | `Settings.ManageAutomationRules`; the tenant's rules, name-ordered |
| POST | /api/automation/rules | `Settings.ManageAutomationRules` + CSRF; `{ name, trigger, conditions, actions }`; 201, or 400 on an invalid shape |
| POST | /api/automation/rules/{id}/enabled | `Settings.ManageAutomationRules` + CSRF; `{ "enabled": bool }`; 200, or 404 |

A rule is `{ trigger, conditions[], actions[] }` from a closed v1 vocabulary — `trigger` is
`WorkCreated`, `WorkStatusChanged` or `WorkNoteAdded` (a resident-visible note added; an
internal note never fires it); a `condition` is `WorkStatusEquals` (`status`) or
`CategoryEquals` (`categoryId`); an `action` is `SetPriority` (`priority`) or
`SendResidentMessage` (`templateId`). At least one action is required.

**Rules execute.** After a work create commits, an explicit status change commits (`PUT
/api/work/{id}`, `POST /api/work/bulk/status`), or a resident-visible note commits (`POST
/api/work/bulk/note` without `internal`), the evaluator runs the tenant's enabled rules
for that trigger, `AND`s every condition against the committed work item, and applies the
matches: `SetPriority` is skipped when the priority already matches or the work is terminal;
`SendResidentMessage` goes through the same path as `POST /api/work/{id}/message`, keyed so a
retry does not double-send. A `WorkNoteAdded` message can render `{{ note.text }}` with the note
body (the engine re-reads the committed note and refuses a non-resident-visible one); consent
and no-resident skips are recorded on the `AutomationApplied` timeline entry, which never
carries internal note text. Each rule is idempotent per occurrence (an `AutomationApplied`
timeline entry fences it), runs in its own transaction, and a failing rule is logged and
skipped without affecting the work write or other rules. Evaluation is post-commit and
in-process — there is no durable retry queue yet.

## Custom field definitions (FS-S03.01)

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/settings/custom-fields | `Work.Read`; the tenant's field definitions, sort-order then name |
| POST | /api/settings/custom-fields | `Settings.ManageConfiguration` + CSRF; `{ key, name, appliesTo, fieldType, options, isRequired, sortOrder }`; 201, 400 on an invalid shape, 409 on a duplicate `(appliesTo, key)` |
| PUT | /api/settings/custom-fields/{id} | `Settings.ManageConfiguration` + CSRF; `{ name, options, isRequired, sortOrder }` — `key`, `appliesTo` and `fieldType` are immutable after creation; 200, 400, or 404 |
| POST | /api/settings/custom-fields/{id}/archive | `Settings.ManageConfiguration` + CSRF; 204 or 404 |

`key` is a stable, lowercase machine identifier (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`, ≤ 50 chars), unique per
`(organization, appliesTo)`; `name` is the display label and may change freely. `appliesTo` is a
closed vocabulary (`ConfigurationEntityType`) — `WorkItem` today, the only entity type a custom
field or a `/api/categories` category can attach to; the two features share the same vocabulary
(FS-S03.03) rather than each keeping its own.
`fieldType` is one of `Text`, `Number`, `Date`, `Boolean`, `SingleSelect`; `options` is required
(≥ 1, unique, ≤ 100 chars each) for `SingleSelect` and rejected for every other type. Archiving
never deletes the row — a value already recorded against an archived definition stays readable.

Attaching a value to a work item (`CustomFieldValue`, validated against the live definition at
write time) is `customFields` on [work create/update and the work detail response](#work-create-and-update)
(FS-S03.02).

## Numbering (FS-S03.04)

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/settings/numbering | `Work.Read`; every configured scheme for the tenant — `{ appliesTo, prefix, width, nextValue, nextFormatted }` |
| PUT | /api/settings/numbering/{appliesTo} | `Settings.ManageConfiguration` + CSRF; `{ prefix, width }`; creates the scheme (starting at 1) if none exists for `appliesTo`, otherwise reconfigures `prefix`/`width` only — `nextValue` cannot be set through this endpoint; 200, or 400 on an invalid width (1–10) or prefix (≤ 20 chars) |

A configured scheme causes every new `WorkItem` to receive a `displayNumber` — `prefix` followed
by `nextValue` zero-padded to `width` (e.g. `WO-00042`) — set once, at creation, and never
reassigned or backfilled onto work created before the scheme existed. The allocation itself is
one atomic SQL statement (`UPDATE ... RETURNING`, not a read-then-increment), so two concurrent
creates can never receive the same number; `displayNumber` also carries a unique index per
organization as a second backstop. `displayNumber` appears on the work list, the work detail
response, and `POST`/`PUT /api/work`'s response — it cannot be set by the caller.

## Approvals (FS-S03.05)

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/approvals | `Work.Read`; tenant-scoped requests, newest first, capped at 200. Optional `?subjectType=`, `?subjectId=`, `?status=` (`Pending`/`Approved`/`Rejected`) |
| POST | /api/approvals | `Work.Read` + CSRF; `{ subjectType, subjectId, note }`; 201, or 400 on a blank `subjectType`/empty `subjectId` |
| POST | /api/approvals/{id}/decide | `Settings.ManageConfiguration` + CSRF; `{ approved, reason }`; 200, 404, 409 if already decided or if the caller is the original requester, 400 on an invalid shape |

A generic, reusable "does someone with authority say yes" primitive — not a replacement for any
feature's own approval state (`Budget`'s `Submit`/`Approve`/`Reject`, for one, keeps its own).
`subjectType` is a validated free-text label (like `TimelineEntry.RelatedObjectType`), not a
closed vocabulary — nothing here validates that the named subject actually exists, since the set
of future subjects isn't enumerable today. v1 is one decision, not a chain: `Approve`/`Reject`
is terminal, and the requester can never be the decider (separation of duties). Every request
and decision is recorded on the tenant timeline (`ApprovalRequested`/`ApprovalDecided`,
`relatedObjectType: "ApprovalRequest"`).

## Organization settings (FS-S03.06)

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/settings/organization | `Work.Read`; never 404s — before anything is saved, returns `defaultTimeZoneId: null` and all seven days closed |
| PUT | /api/settings/organization | `Settings.ManageConfiguration` + CSRF; `{ defaultTimeZoneId, businessHours: [{ day, open, close }, ...] }`; upserts the one row per organization. 400 on an invalid IANA zone, a week missing a day, a duplicate day, an open time without a matching close, or open ≥ close |

`businessHours` is exactly seven entries, one per `System.DayOfWeek` name (`"Sunday"` …
`"Saturday"`), each carrying `open`/`close` as `"HH:mm:ss"` or both `null` for a closed day — a
partial update is rejected rather than defaulting the missing day, so a client can't accidentally
leave a stale day in place. `defaultTimeZoneId` is a fallback for a property that doesn't set its
own (`Property.TimeZoneId`, PF-7.04, always wins over this when a property has one), validated
the same way (`Region/City` IANA form — a bare `UTC` is rejected).

Storage and validation only, the same order templates existed before dispatch did (PF-4.03 vs
PF-4.05): nothing reads these settings yet, so there is no "closed for business" enforcement
anywhere in the codebase today.

## Staff notification preferences (FS-S03.07)

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/settings/notification-preferences | `Work.Read`; returns all three event types for the caller, `{ eventType, enabled }[]` — a type with no stored row reads `enabled: true` |
| PUT | /api/settings/notification-preferences/{eventType} | `Work.Read` + CSRF; `{ enabled }`; upserts the caller's own preference for that event type. 400 on an unknown `eventType` |

Personal settings, not org configuration — gated on plain `Work.Read` like `/api/saved-views`,
not `Settings.ManageConfiguration`: any staff member (including Read Only) manages their own
preferences, always scoped to their own user id from the session, never a request parameter.

`eventType` is one of `WorkAssigned`, `AutomationApplied`, `InvitationReceived` — a closed
vocabulary, the same shape as `ConfigurationEntityType`, naming the events that already fire
somewhere in the codebase (`EmployeeAssigned`, `AutomationApplied` on the timeline,
`IdentityAuditLog.EventTypes.InvitationSent`). The default is opt-out: a missing row means
enabled, so a brand-new user reads as fully subscribed rather than fully silent. **No delivery
channel is wired to any of this yet** — today only residents have a messaging pipeline
(`IResidentMessenger`); this is the preference model and its API only, not a promise of
delivery.

## Global search (milestone 6)

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/search | `Work.Read`; `?q=` (2–100 characters after trimming, else 400) and optional `?limit=` (1–50, default 20); returns a ranked JSON array of hits |

Each hit is `{ "type", "id", "label", "sublabel", "score" }`. `type` is one of `Property`,
`Building`, `Space`, `Resident`, `Vendor`, `Employee`, `Category`, `Asset`, `Work`. `sublabel`
is a secondary identifier where one exists (a resident's email or phone, an asset's serial
number, an employee's email) and is otherwise `null`.

Matching is case-insensitive and index-backed: both the substring match and the
word-similarity (typo) match ride the `gin_trgm_ops` indexes — the similarity floor is 0.25,
applied per search via a transaction-local `pg_trgm.word_similarity_threshold`. A substring
match always outranks a similarity-only match, so a query that is a typo of a name still finds
it but ranks below any literal substring hit. Residents also match on email and phone, assets on
serial number and model, employees on email. Every query runs through the tenant query filter
and row-level security, so results never cross an organization. The result set is capped at
`limit` hits total across all types.

## Attention queue (milestone 6)

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/attention | `Work.Read`; the actionable attention queue for the tenant — `{ items: [...], criticalCount, warningCount, informationalCount }` |

Each item is
`{ workId, title, propertyId, propertyName, status, priority, dueDate, severity, findings }`,
and each entry in `findings` is `{ reason, severity, detail }`. There is **one item per work
item**, however many rules it trips; `findings` carries them all, most urgent first, and the
item's `severity` is the most urgent among them. Items are ordered by `severity`
(Critical → Warning → Informational), then soonest `dueDate`, then work id.

The three counts are of **distinct work items** with at least one finding at that severity, so a
work item flagged both Critical and Warning is counted in each — and each count is exactly the
number of items whose `findings` contain that severity, which is what the `/attention` severity
cards filter the list to. The card and the list can therefore never disagree.

`reason` is one of:

| reason | severity | when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UnassignedEmergency` | Critical | `Critical` priority, open, with no vendor and no employee |
| `SlaBreach` | Critical for `Critical`/`High`, else Warning | still `New` past the first-response budget (Critical 4h, High 24h, Normal 72h, Low 120h from creation) |
| `Overdue` | Critical when the work is `Critical` priority, else Warning | `dueDate` in the past and not `Completed` |
| `WaitingOnVendor` | Warning | `OnHold` with a vendor assigned and no activity for 7 days |
| `WaitingOnResident` | Informational | `OnHold` with a resident (no vendor) and no activity for 7 days |
| `RepeatRepair` | Warning | open work on an asset over the repeat-repair count in the policy window |
| `UnitTurnAtRisk` | Critical when already past due, else Warning | a `UnitTurnTask` still `New`/`Assigned` and due within 5 days |

`Completed`, `Cancelled` and `Draft` work never appears. The thresholds are fixed in this
release (`AttentionThresholds`) — per-organization tuning is a follow-up. Every query runs
through the tenant query filter and row-level security.

## Integrations (milestone 6)

Adapters pull records from external property-management systems and PropFlow tracks what each
one has seen. It records the external side only — reconciling those records into Properties /
Spaces / Work / Assets is a later task (FS-S19).

Two adapters are registered: `mock`, the deterministic in-memory one milestone 6 shipped, and
`sandbox` (PF-S19.07), an HTTP client against a PropFlow-defined JSON contract —
[`integration-sandbox-contract.md`](integration-sandbox-contract.md) says what a sandbox server
must serve and how a connection's credential is configured. `sandbox` appears in
`GET /api/integrations/sources` whether or not it is configured; a connection created against it
fails its first sync with a `lastError` naming the configuration key that is missing.

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/integrations/sources | `Integrations.Manage`; the adapters this deployment knows (`{ sourceSystem, displayName }`) |
| GET | /api/integrations | `Integrations.Manage`; every connection with its health snapshot |
| GET | /api/integrations/{id} | `Integrations.Manage`; one connection's health, or 404 |
| GET | /api/integrations/{id}/records | `Integrations.Manage`; a page of the external records the connection tracks, newest sighting first; `?page=` / `?pageSize=` (1–200, default 50); `{ items, totalCount, page, pageSize }`, or 404 |
| POST | /api/integrations | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; `{ sourceSystem, displayName }`; 201, 400 for an unknown source system or invalid text, 409 if a connection to that source already exists |
| POST | /api/integrations/{id}/enable | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; 204 or 404 |
| POST | /api/integrations/{id}/disable | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; 204 or 404 |
| POST | /api/integrations/{id}/sync | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; runs a pull and reconciles it; 200 with a sync report, 404, or 409 if the connection is disabled or a sync is already running |
| GET | /api/integrations/{id}/conflicts | `Integrations.Manage`; the conflict queue, open first; `?status=` / `?kind=` / `?reason=` / `?page=` / `?pageSize=` (1–200, default 50); `{ items, totalCount, openCount, staleCount, page, pageSize }`, 400 on an unparseable filter, 404 |
| POST | /api/integrations/{id}/conflicts/{conflictId}/resolve | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; optional `{ note }`; 204, 404, or 409 if already resolved or ignored |
| POST | /api/integrations/{id}/conflicts/{conflictId}/ignore | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; optional `{ note }`; 204, 404, or 409 if already resolved or ignored |
| GET | /api/integrations/{id}/mappings | `Integrations.Manage`; every mapping profile for the connection with its rules and validation issues; 404 |
| PUT | /api/integrations/{id}/mappings/{kind} | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; upserts the profile for that entity kind; `{ targetPortfolioId, defaultCreatorId, defaultTimeZoneId }`; 201 on create, 200 on update, 400 for an unknown kind, 404 |
| POST | /api/integrations/{id}/mappings/{kind}/rules | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; `{ sourceField, sourceValue, targetValue }`; 201, 400 for an unknown kind or source field, a rule that does not apply to that kind, or blank/over-long values, 404 |
| DELETE | /api/integrations/{id}/mappings/{kind}/rules/{ruleId} | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; 204, 400 for an unknown kind, 404 |
| POST | /api/integrations/{id}/mappings/{kind}/promote | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; moves the profile to `AutoApply`; 200 `{ mode, issues }`, 400 for an unknown kind, 404, or **409 carrying the `issues` list while the profile still has validation errors** |
| POST | /api/integrations/{id}/mappings/{kind}/report-only | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; moves the profile back to `ReportOnly`; 204, 400 for an unknown kind, 404 |
| GET | /api/integrations/{id}/runs | `Integrations.Manage`; run history newest first; `?page=` / `?pageSize=` (1–200, default 25); `{ items, totalCount, page, pageSize }`, 404 |
| GET | /api/integrations/{id}/runs/{runId} | `Integrations.Manage`; one run with its counts, or 404 |
| POST | /api/integrations/{id}/records/{recordId}/retire | `Integrations.Manage` + CSRF; operator-invoked retirement of one link; 204, 404, or 409 if already retired |

`{kind}` is an `IntegrationEntityKind` name — `Property`, `Space`, `Occupancy`, `WorkOrder`,
`Asset`, `Resident`, `Building` — matched case-insensitively; anything else is a 400 naming the
value. There is **no route that deletes a conflict**: resolution is a status transition, and the
runtime role holds no `DELETE` grant on `integrations."Conflicts"` to make one with, because a
resolved conflict is the record that a human looked at a divergence and made a call.

A conflict is `{ id, connectionId, kind, externalId, reason, field, observedValue, currentValue,
detail, status, firstSeenInRunId, lastSeenInRunId, firstSeenAt, lastSeenAt, observationCount,
resolvedByUserId, resolvedAt, resolutionNote, seenInLatestRun }`. `reason` is `UnmappedValue` /
`MissingRequiredMapping` / `MissingParentLink` / `UpstreamDisappearance` / `AmbiguousMatch` /
`ValidationRefusal`; `status` is `Open` / `Resolved` / `Ignored`. `seenInLatestRun` is false when
the connection's most recent **completed** run no longer detected the divergence — the reconciler
stops re-observing a conflict it can no longer see but never closes one on its own, so this is how
a caller tells "still broken" from "fixed, and the row is just waiting to be closed".
`staleCount` is how many open conflicts are in that state.

A mapping profile is `{ id, connectionId, kind, mode, targetPortfolioId, defaultCreatorId,
defaultTimeZoneId, createdAt, updatedAt, rules, issues, canAutoApply, availableSourceFields }`,
where `mode` is `ReportOnly` / `AutoApply`, a rule is `{ id, sourceField, sourceValue,
targetValue }`, and an issue is `{ severity, field, reason }` with `severity` `Error` or
`Unmapped`. **A profile is created `ReportOnly` and there is no way to create one that is not** —
promotion is a separate, refusable step, so a first connect cannot silently rewrite a tenant's
property names. `Unmapped` issues are informational (the four `CanonicalProperty` address fields
have nowhere to go) and never block promotion; `Error` issues do, and promote returns them in the
409 body so an operator sees exactly what to fix. Editing a profile's defaults in a way that
reintroduces an error demotes it back to `ReportOnly` rather than leaving it applying with a
missing fact.

A sync run is `{ id, connectionId, trigger, attemptNumber, status, startedAt, heartbeatAt,
completedAt, seen, added, updated, failed, conflicted, error, snapshotHash }`, where `trigger` is
`Manual` / `Scheduled` / `Retry` and `status` is `Running` / `Completed` / `Failed`.

A health snapshot is `{ id, sourceSystem, displayName, isEnabled, lastAttemptedAt,
lastSucceededAt, consecutiveFailures, lastError, trackedRecords, failedRecords, openConflicts }`.
`openConflicts` is the unresolved-conflict badge: a conflict is deliberately not a failure, so
without it a connection raising the same unmapped-status conflict on every run looks identical to
a clean one. A sync report
is `{ outcome, seen, added, updated, failed, error, conflicted, retired, runId }` where `outcome`
is `Completed` / `Failed` / `NotFound` / `Disabled` / `AlreadyRunning`.

**The counters changed meaning in PF-S19.05 and are now about PropFlow rows, not external record
links.** `seen` is canonical records in the snapshot; `added` and `updated` are PropFlow rows
created and updated; `failed` is records a domain invariant refused; `conflicted` is records that
raised a conflict, upstream disappearances included; `retired` is links the source stopped
reporting, whose PropFlow rows are left untouched. Re-syncing an unchanged source still reports
zero `added` and `updated`, because a link whose `reconciledHash` already equals its
`contentHash` is skipped. A connection with no mapping profile reports `added` 0 and a non-zero
`conflicted` on its first sync — that is the intended connect → sync → review → promote → sync
flow, not a failure.

A tracked record is `{ kind, externalId, contentHash, reconciledHash, internalId, syncState,
lastSeenAt, lastReconciledAt, lastRunId, lastError }`; `kind` is `Property` / `Space` /
`Occupancy` / `WorkOrder` / `Asset` / `Resident` / `Building` and `syncState` is `Pending` /
`Synced` / `Failed` / `Conflicted` / `Retired`. `contentHash` is what the source last said and
`reconciledHash` is what was last written into PropFlow; the two differing is what makes a
replayed sync converge rather than lose a change.

`Integrations.Manage` is granted to Organization Admin and Property Manager only. The
Integrations tables live in their own `integrations` schema with forced RLS, so a connection and
its records never cross an organization.
## Billing acceptance workflows (FS-S08)

Billing also exposes tenant-scoped payment-method vault metadata (provider token and last four only), one immutable receipt per settled payment, idempotent provider-reference reconciliation records, and delinquency cases with run/contact/resolve transitions. Raw card or bank credentials are never stored.

## Accounting acceptance workflows (FS-S09)

Accounting includes first-class payable and receivable invoices with settlement/void transitions, plus bank accounts linked to asset accounts and idempotent imported bank transactions that can be matched to posted journal entries. All records are tenant-scoped and journal/period controls remain enforced.

## Procurement and vendor operations (FS-S14)

The `Procurement.Read` / `Procurement.Manage` capabilities protect vendor onboarding and purchasing. The API provides vendor profiles, expiring insurance/license/certification documents, contracts, rate cards, bids and bid selection, purchase orders, work authorizations, invoice matching, and performance reviews. Purchase orders above their approval threshold enter `PendingApproval`; an active expired insurance or license document blocks submission. Only issued purchase orders can be matched, and a match cannot exceed the PO amount. Every mutating PO action writes an append-only cross-module timeline entry. All queries and foreign keys are organization-scoped and PostgreSQL RLS applies in production.

| POST | `/api/procurement/purchase-orders/{id}/submit`, `/approve`, `/issue` | Enforce document and approval state machine |
| POST | `/api/procurement/purchase-orders/{id}/match-invoice` | Match a tenant/vendor payable invoice to an issued PO |
| GET/POST | `/api/procurement/authorizations` | List or create work authorizations; `POST /{id}/approve` approves |
| GET/POST | `/api/procurement/vendors/{vendorId}/performance` | Read or add scored performance reviews |

## Budgets and owner accounting (FS-S10)

`/api/owner-accounting` provides tenant-scoped budgets, approval transitions, monthly lines,
actual-vs-budget variance, owner/property ownership, management fees, distributions, and
reproducible immutable owner statements. Journal lines may carry an optional `propertyId` for
property reporting. Managers use `Accounting.Manage`; statement reads also accept
`Accounting.OwnerRead` (granted to the Owner role). A repeated statement request returns the
existing snapshot, whose response includes `netOwnerAmount` and a SHA-256 `sourceHash`.

## Rental applications and screening (FS-S05)

`/api/applications` is the FS-S05 surface: intake, consent, third-party screening and the
approve/deny trail. Every route requires `Applications.Manage`. `Applications.ReadPii` is a
second, separately revocable capability that unmasks contact details, income and screening
detail; `Regional Manager` holds the first and not the second.

**Masking.** In a masked response the PII properties are **absent from the JSON**, not null — a
null means "no value is held", an absent property means "you may not see this". The masked fields
are `email`, `phone`, `monthlyIncome`, `employmentStatus` on each applicant and `score`,
`summary`, `receivedAt` on each screening row. `name`, `role`, screening `status`, `attempts` and
`recommendation` stay visible so a queue is workable without the PII capability. List and detail
unmask automatically for a caller holding `Applications.ReadPii`; `GET /{id}/pii` requires it, so
a denial is a visible 403 rather than a quietly thinner object.

There is no per-read PII access-log table. It was considered and declined: it would be the
highest-write table in the `operations` schema and arrives with its own retention story.

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/applications/ | Applications.Manage; tenant-scoped applications, optional `?listingId=` and `?status=`, newest submitted first, capped at 500; masked unless the caller holds Applications.ReadPii |
| POST | /api/applications/ | Applications.Manage + CSRF; creates a Draft application against a listing; 201, or 404 when the listing does not exist |
| GET | /api/applications/{id} | Applications.Manage; application with its applicants and screening rows, or 404; masked unless the caller holds Applications.ReadPii |
| GET | /api/applications/{id}/pii | **Applications.ReadPii**; the same record always unmasked; 403 without the capability, 404 when the application does not exist |
| POST | /api/applications/{id}/applicants | Applications.Manage + CSRF; adds a person to the application as Primary/CoApplicant/Guarantor with optional monthly income and employment status; 404 unknown application or applicant, 409 for a second Primary, a duplicate person, a co-applicant before the Primary, or a terminal application |
| POST | /api/applications/{id}/submit | Applications.Manage + CSRF; Draft → Submitted; 409 unless Draft and a Primary applicant exists |
| GET | /api/applications/{id}/consent | Applications.Manage; `{ applicationId, effective, history }` — the full append-only row history plus the reduction to the latest row per (applicant, check). Not masked: consent rows carry no PII |
| POST | /api/applications/{id}/consent | Applications.Manage + CSRF; records one Granted/Revoked consent row (a revocation is a new row, never an edit). Advances Submitted → ConsentGranted once every applicant holds at least one effective grant; 201 with `{ consent, applicationStatus }`, 400 for an applicant not on the application or an Unknown decision |
| POST | /api/applications/{id}/withdraw | Applications.Manage + CSRF; any non-terminal state → Withdrawn; 409 when already terminal |
| GET | /api/applications/{id}/screening | Applications.Manage; screening requests with attempts, last error and the latest verdict; masked unless the caller holds Applications.ReadPii |
| POST | /api/applications/{id}/screening | Applications.Manage + CSRF; ConsentGranted → Screening, then one provider call per consented applicant. 200 and Screening → UnderReview when every applicant's screening completes; **503 and no verdict written** on a provider outage; 409 from any state but ConsentGranted or Screening, or when no applicant on the application holds effective consent. **Idempotent**: re-posting while already in Screening re-attempts the still-pending requests rather than conflicting, so a client that received a 503 can retry the URL it posted to. Entering Screening still requires ConsentGranted — that is the consent gate and it is unaffected |
| POST | /api/applications/{id}/screening/{requestId}/retry | Applications.Manage + CSRF; re-attempts one Pending request; 409 when the request is not Pending or the applicant's consent has since been revoked; 503 on a further outage. The attempt that reaches `Screening:MaxAttempts` moves the request to Abandoned, and when every request for the application is Abandoned the application returns to ConsentGranted |

**Attempt cycles.** A screening request's idempotency key is
`application:{id}:applicant:{id}:cycle:{n}`. The cycle is what makes `AbandonScreening`'s promise
reachable: a key fixed per (application, applicant) would have let the unique index refuse any
replacement forever, so an applicant whose provider was down for its whole retry budget could
never be screened again. A new cycle is minted only once every earlier one is Abandoned; a live
(Pending/InFlight) request is reused, and an applicant who already Completed is not re-screened.

**Provider outage.** `ScreeningRecommendation.Unavailable` means the provider could not answer,
and `ScreeningResult` refuses to store it, so an outage can never become a persisted verdict. The
response is 503. What *is* written on that path is the `ScreeningRequest` row and its attempt
counter — the retry ledger, not an answer about the applicant — because retry exhaustion cannot
be reached by a counter that is not persisted.

**Retry ceiling.** `Screening:MaxAttempts` (default 3, must be at least 1, validated at startup).
Configuration rather than a constant or a request field: a constant cannot be tuned when a
bureau's availability turns out worse than assumed, and a request field would let a caller grant
itself unlimited retries against a paid third party.

**The consent gate is checked twice.** The domain refuses any status but `ConsentGranted`, and
the endpoint separately re-checks effective consent per applicant immediately before the provider
call — a revocation recorded after the application reached `ConsentGranted` is invisible to the
status alone.
| POST | /api/applications/{id}/approve | Applications.Manage + CSRF; UnderReview → Approved with a required `reason` code and optional `note`; 201 with `{ decision, applicationStatus }`, 409 unless UnderReview, and 409 with an actionable message when any screening verdict is `Fail` and no override `note` was supplied |
| POST | /api/applications/{id}/deny | Applications.Manage + CSRF; UnderReview → Denied with a required `reason` code and optional `note`; 201 with `{ decision, applicationStatus }`, 409 unless UnderReview |
| GET | /api/applications/{id}/decisions | Applications.Manage; the append-only decision trail, newest first. Not masked: a reason code is not applicant PII |

**Approving over a failed screening.** A `Fail` recommendation does **not** hard-block approval —
a hard block makes individualized assessment impossible — but approving over one requires a
non-blank `note`, so the override is never silent. The rule is a domain refusal in
`RentalApplication.Approve`, not an endpoint check, and the 409 body carries the domain's own
message rather than a bare "conflict".

**The legacy applicant-status route is fenced.**
`PUT /api/marketing/listings/{id}/applicants/{applicantId}/status` sets a flat status on the
person, with no consent check and no decision row. It now returns **409** once a rental
application exists for that applicant, naming `/api/applications` instead. It still works for an
applicant with no application, so nothing that predates FS-S05 breaks. PF-S05.09 rewired the
`/marketing/listings` Applicants panel off it: the panel's "Start screening" and "Approve"
buttons are gone, and the applicant now enters `/api/applications` through a **Start application**
control. Nothing in `apps/web` calls the legacy route any more — `api.marketing.listings
.applicantStatus` (`apps/web/lib/api.ts`) is kept as a client for a route that is still live for
an applicant with no application, not because a page uses it.
# Reporting (FS-S18)

Authenticated users with `Reports.Read` can query `/api/reports/{kind}` for `operational`,
`leasing`, `financial`, `occupancy`, `maintenance`, `vendor`, or `portfolio`. Optional `from`,
`to`, `propertyId`, and bounded `take` filters are tenant-scoped. `/api/reports/{kind}/export`
returns the same projection as UTF-8 CSV. Users with `Settings.ManageConfiguration` can create,
list, pause, and run persisted schedules at `/api/reports/schedules`; due schedules are dispatched
by the API worker and recorded in `ReportDeliveries` with a payload hash and next-run time.

# Autopilot daily brief (CPM-8.05)

Every route needs `Autopilot.Manage` — there is no read-only Autopilot role yet (see
`Capabilities.cs`'s own comment on why reviewing/deciding/giving feedback are treated as one
capability, not split the way applications split manage from read-PII).

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /api/autopilot/runs | Runs every CPM-8.02 analyzer for the tenant and persists the findings + evidence it detects, bound to a new `AutopilotRun`. `{ trigger? }` in the body (default `"Manual"`). Returns `{ runId, findingCount }`; `502` if the run itself failed (the run row is still saved, as `Failed`) |
| GET | /api/autopilot/brief | The paginated, filtered, ordered list of findings — see below |
| POST | /api/autopilot/findings/{id}/review | `New` → `Reviewed` |
| POST | /api/autopilot/findings/{id}/dismiss | → `Dismissed` (terminal). Optional `{ reason? }` |
| POST | /api/autopilot/findings/{id}/resolve | → `Resolved` (terminal) |
| POST | /api/autopilot/findings/{id}/snooze | → `Snoozed` (not terminal). `{ until }`, must be in the future |
| POST | /api/autopilot/findings/{id}/reopen | `Snoozed`/`Dismissed`/`Resolved` → `New`, clearing every decision field — the one sanctioned exit from all three, mirroring `WorkItem.Reopen` |
| POST | /api/autopilot/findings/{id}/read | Marks the finding read for the calling user (upsert; a later call only ever moves the read marker forward) |
| POST | /api/autopilot/findings/{id}/feedback | Appends an `AutopilotFeedback` row. `{ sentiment: "Helpful" \| "NotHelpful", comment? }` |

The five decision routes (`review`/`dismiss`/`resolve`/`snooze`/`reopen`) return the updated
finding, `400` for a bad request (an empty actor, a past `until`), `409` when the finding's
current state refuses the transition (already terminal, or reopening a finding that was never
closed), `404` if the finding does not exist in this tenant.

`GET /api/autopilot/brief` takes `propertyId`, `portfolioId`, `signalType`, `status`
(`New`/`Reviewed`/`Snoozed`/`Dismissed`/`Resolved`), `page`, `pageSize` (clamped 1–200, default
50) — all optional. Without `status`, the brief shows everything **except** `Dismissed`/
`Resolved`, the same "the default view is the workable set" shape `/api/work`'s list gives
completed work. Ordered by `severity` (`Critical` → `Warning` → `Informational`, the enum's own
declared order — stored as an integer specifically so the database sorts it correctly, not
alphabetically), then the largest `EstimatedAmount` on the finding's evidence, then soonest
`detectedAt`.

Each item is `{ id, signalType, severity, subjectType, subjectId, summary, detectedAt,
freshnessAsOf, propertyId, portfolioId, status, snoozedUntil, isRead, inputs, sourceLinks,
impact, confidence }` — `inputs` is `[{ name, value }]`, `sourceLinks` is
`[{ entityType, entityId }]`, `impact` is `{ category, description, estimatedAmount }` or `null`
(never a guessed `estimatedAmount` — see `docs/backlog.md`'s CPM-8.03 note on "never fabricates
missing values"). `propertyId`/`portfolioId` are `null` for a finding with no property
association (an invoice exception on a vendor-level payable, for instance) — that is a fact
about the finding, not missing data.

# Governed actions (CPM-8.07/8.08)

Same `Autopilot.Manage` capability as the brief above gates every route here too. A governed
action reaches execution through a fixed chain: a `Finding` gets a human-written
`AutopilotRecommendation` (no generation intelligence — CPM-8.08 added just enough persistence to
unblock the chain CPM-8.01 always assumed, not automatic recommendation authoring), the
recommendation is `Approve`d by someone other than whoever proposed it, **then** one of seven
typed `AutopilotActionProposal`s can be proposed against it, approved (again, not by its own
proposer), and only then executed.

| Method | Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /api/autopilot/findings/{id}/recommendations | `{ description }` → a new `Proposed` recommendation |
| GET | /api/autopilot/findings/{id}/recommendations | List recommendations for a finding, newest first |
| POST | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/approve | `Proposed` → `Approved`. `409` if the caller is the proposer or it is already decided |
| POST | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/reject | `Proposed` → `Rejected` (terminal). Optional `{ reason? }` |
| POST | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/actions/assign-vendor | `{ workId, vendorId }` |
| POST | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/actions/assign-employee | `{ workId, employeeId }` |
| POST | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/actions/schedule-work | `{ workId, scheduledStart, scheduledEnd }` |
| POST | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/actions/follow-up | `{ propertyId, title, description?, dueDate? }` — creates a new `WorkItem` on execution |
| POST | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/actions/communication-draft | `{ recipientType: "Resident" \| "Vendor", recipientId, channel: "Sms" \| "Email", draftText }` — execution never sends; it records the draft as the outcome |
| POST | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/actions/request-approval | `{ subjectType, subjectId, note? }` — execution creates an `ApprovalRequest` (FS-S03), it does not touch the subject |
| POST | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/actions/purchase-order-draft | `{ vendorId, propertyId?, workItemId?, number, amount, approvalThreshold }` — execution creates a `PurchaseOrder` in `PurchaseOrderStatus.Draft` |
| GET | /api/autopilot/recommendations/{id}/actions | List action proposals for a recommendation, newest first |
| POST | /api/autopilot/actions/{id}/approve | `Proposed` → `Approved`. `409` if the caller is the proposer or it is already decided |
| POST | /api/autopilot/actions/{id}/reject | `Proposed` → `Rejected` (terminal). Optional `{ reason? }` |
| POST | /api/autopilot/actions/{id}/execute | Runs the real subsystem mutation for an `Approved` proposal — see below |

Every "propose an action" route requires the recommendation to be `Approved` (`409` otherwise) and
returns `201` with the proposal, or `400` if a referenced id (a work item, most commonly) does not
exist. Each derives a deterministic `IdempotencyKey` of `{recommendationId}:{actionType}` — at
most one proposal of a given action type can exist per recommendation, so a retried POST (a
network timeout resubmit, a double click) collides (`409`) with the first attempt instead of
creating a duplicate, rather than needing a client-supplied idempotency header.

`POST .../execute` re-checks the proposal's `RequiredExecutionCapability` against the *calling
actor's own* claims — not whatever was true when it was approved, which may have been a different
session or a while ago — and returns `403` if the actor no longer holds it, **without** marking
the proposal `Failed` (it stays `Approved`, so a correctly-authorized actor can retry). For the
one action type that sets `RequiredConsentType` (`communication-draft`, to a resident), execution
also checks `Resident.AllowsContact` for the requested channel and returns `409` — again without
marking `Failed` — if consent has not been granted. Past both checks, the adapter for the
proposal's `ActionType` runs; on success the proposal moves to `Executed` with the real outcome
text, on an adapter-level failure (a `WorkItem` version conflict, most commonly — `ScheduleWork`
and the two assignment actions carry the target's version as `ConcurrencyToken`, captured when the
action was proposed) it moves to `Failed` with the reason, and both cases return `200` — the
executor ran either way; the failure is on the proposal, not the request.

No autonomous payment, lease, bank, role, or audit mutation exists among these seven action
types, matching `docs/backlog.md`'s own CPM-8.08 scope line. `communication-draft` in particular
never reaches the Communications outbox — sending stays a human action through the existing
communications surface.
