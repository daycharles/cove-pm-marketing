# Implementation milestones

This file defines the milestones. The epic and task-level breakdown for the
remaining work (milestones 3–9, including the cross-cutting hardening track),
lives in [backlog.md](backlog.md) and is the source for GitHub milestones and issues.

## 1 — Repository and foundation (implemented)

Initialize local Git, pin the SDK, create domain/application/API boundaries, add fail-closed tenant resolution and capability policy wiring, domain assignment/audit semantics, centralized HTTP errors, structured console logs, health endpoint, Compose database configuration, CI, and executable foundation checks. No login or persistent operations are represented as complete.

## 2 — Tenant-aware identity and persistence (implemented)

Add ASP.NET Identity, organization membership, capability mappings, cookie login/logout, CSRF protection, EF Core/PostgreSQL context, migrations, query/write isolation, composite tenant foreign keys, and database readiness. Add real PostgreSQL integration tests proving cross-tenant reads, writes, assignments, and spoofed tenant inputs are blocked.

Delivered: explicit administrative provisioning, revocable secure-cookie sessions, current-membership capability checks, PostgreSQL RLS with a restricted runtime role, centrally scoped EF reads/writes, real migrations, single-item assignment with atomic append-only history, OpenAPI, local setup instructions, dependency locks and database-backed CI. The Next.js UI, bulk assignment and full property/demo data were left to milestone 3, which has since delivered them.

## 3 — First usable vertical slice (implemented)

Create Next.js UI, property/space/vendor/work persistence, seed two organizations for isolation tests, and implement login → work list → multi-select → assign vendor → confirm → updated timeline. Provide search/filtering and a unified work detail workspace. Test rollback, unauthorized assignment, stale updates, and successful audit creation end to end.

Delivered: the Organization→Portfolio→Property→Building→Space hierarchy, expanded `Vendor`/`Employee`/`WorkItem` entities with migrations and forced RLS, the generalized `TimelineEntry`, work create/update behind `Work.Create`/`Work.Update`, a filtered/sorted/paginated work list with the `xmin` version on every row, single and bulk vendor assignment plus employee assignment, user-scoped saved views, a demo seed covering every status and priority, the Next.js work list/detail/saved-views UI, and the `web` and `e2e` CI jobs. All 27 M3 issues are closed (epic `#1`, tasks `#6`–`#31`) and the slice was promoted to `main` in `b31b864`. **PF-3.27** — refuse vendor/employee assignment on `Completed`/`Cancelled` work, plus `docs/demo-script.md` — also shipped against this milestone (`baf4498`, PR #98); it was written after the M3 issues were cut, so it is the one M3 task with no tracker issue. Still open against this milestone: Tailwind is a declared dependency (`apps/web/package.json:24`) imported by `apps/web/app/styles.css:1` but nothing processes it — there is no PostCSS config and no `@tailwindcss/postcss` — and the migration note below stands. The `TimelineEntry` generalization was the third carry-forward and is now closed: PF-3.10 finished it in `c362bfd` (PR #107), dropping the legacy `PreviousVendorId`/`VendorId` columns in migration `20260910122538_TimelineDropLegacyVendorColumns`.

> **Migration note:** the `M3Operations` migration adds required `WorkItems` columns (`PropertyId`, `CreatorId`) and their foreign keys in one step with a `Guid.Empty` default, and backfills `Vendors.IsActive` to `false`. It applies cleanly only to a database with no pre-M3 `WorkItems`/`Vendors` rows. Before the first real deployment the M3 migration set must be squashed or rewritten to be safe against a populated milestone-2 database (nullable column → backfill → set NOT NULL → add FK).

## 4 — Polished pest-control workflow (implemented)

Bulk scheduling and assignment, resident templates, mock SMS/email, durable outbox, idempotent dispatch, success summary, saved views, and mobile interaction. Seed Tidewater Residential Management with 3 properties, approximately 10 buildings, 80 spaces, 70 residents, 6 vendors, 5 employees, 100 work items, and 60 assets. Include at least 18 pest-control requests.

All 12 task issues (`#32`–`#43`) are closed. The domain and API: the resident/occupancy domain — `Resident` and `Occupancy` with contact fields, per-channel SMS/email consent and `AllowsContact`, `operations`-schema tables with forced RLS, and the read plus `People.Manage` write endpoints (PF-4.01 `#32`, PF-4.02 `#33`); the communication provider abstraction with recording mock SMS and email senders (PF-4.04 `#35`); the `communications`-schema transactional outbox with an idempotency key and an `xmin`-claimed at-most-once dispatch worker (PF-4.05 `#36`); the extended bulk work actions — `bulk/status`, `bulk/priority`, `bulk/schedule`, `bulk/note`, `bulk/reopen`, each bounded to 100 items in one all-or-nothing transaction with a per-item version check (PF-4.07 `#38`). `add tag` is carved out of PF-4.07 pending the tag-vocabulary decision. Resident messaging (PF-4.03 `#34`, PF-4.06 `#37`): `POST /api/work/{id}/message` renders a template — the schedule values in the property's time zone — against the work item's resident and queues it; outbox rows carry `WorkId` and `ResidentVisible`, and `GET /api/work/{id}/timeline` folds them in.

The web and test layer: the assign-and-notify flow (PF-4.08 `#39` / PR #120) — one vendor, an optional visit window, an optional resident message, applied as `bulk/vendor` → `bulk/schedule` → per-item send with a per-step outcome summary; the mobile-responsive work list and detail (PF-4.09 `#40`); the Tidewater seed (PF-4.10 `#41`); the bulk pest-control demo e2e (PF-4.11 `#42`, `apps/web/e2e/pest-control-demo.spec.ts`); and the outbox-idempotency / template-rendering / consent test pass (PF-4.12 `#43`).

Carried forward (audit-communications C11, tracked in [followups.md](followups.md)): the timeline merge is read-side only — there is no path that enqueues an outbox row inside the transaction of the work event that triggers it. That waits on the M5 event wiring, which has since landed.

## 5 — Events and field workflows (implemented)

Add technician On The Way workflow, predefined configurable automation rules, communication status in the timeline, notes with explicit visibility, and remaining authorized bulk actions.

All 14 M5 task issues are closed. `#44`–`#54` (PF-5.01–5.11) shipped with the parallel field-workflow track; PF-5.12, PF-5.13 and PF-5.14 followed later. Delivered: the property/assignment authorization scope model (`WorkAccessScope`) and the scoped `Technician`/`Vendor` grants — a field role is inert until its membership names the employee/vendor, then narrowed to assigned work (PF-5.01/5.02); the "On The Way" status workflow with its timeline event and `Work.MarkOnTheWay` capability (PF-5.03); the persisted WHEN/IF/THEN automation rules with a predefined action set and their admin screen at `/settings/automation` behind `Settings.ManageAutomationRules` (PF-5.04/5.05), and the evaluator that runs them — `EfWorkOperations` raises `WorkCreated`/`WorkStatusChanged` after the change commits, `IAutomationEngine` matches the tenant's enabled rules and applies `SetPriority` / `SendResidentMessage` idempotently, each rule fenced and isolated (PF-5.13), and the `WorkNoteAdded` trigger with a consent-honoring resident notification — a resident-visible note fires a rule whose message template can render `{{ note.text }}`, deduped through the outbox and with queued/skipped status on the timeline (PF-5.14); visibility-scoped notes across API and web (PF-5.06); inline communication status on the work timeline (PF-5.07); the message and employee bulk actions wired to the toolbar (PF-5.08), later joined by a "Bulk edit…" flow for status, priority, schedule, note and reopen (PF-5.12); a technician mobile view (PF-5.09); the `technician-on-the-way.spec.ts` e2e (PF-5.10); and the scope-model denial tests (PF-5.11). Milestone 6 was built in parallel, so milestone number is not milestone order.

## 6 — Assets and attention (implemented, built in parallel with milestone 5)

Asset maintenance history, configurable repeat-repair detection (initial example: 3 repairs in 120 days), actionable attention queue, fuzzy global search, integration adapters and integration health foundation. Keep unsupported reports or integrations out of navigation until usable.

All 13 task issues (`#55`–`#67`) are closed and on `main` (promoted in PR #149). Delivered:

- **Assets** — the `Asset` domain (type, make/model/serial, install date, warranty, service life, condition, replacement cost, notes) with forced RLS and read/write API behind `Assets.Manage` (PF-6.01 `#55`); the optional `WorkItem.AssetId` link — same-property enforced, `AssetLinked` timeline entry, composite FK and `(OrganizationId, AssetId)` index (PF-6.02 `#56`); the `/assets/[id]` detail page over `GET /api/assets/{id}/history` — the asset record, its maintenance history newest-first, and `workOrderCount` / `totalCost` / `ageInYears` roll-ups (PF-6.03 `#57`).
- **Repeat-repair detection** — a per-org `RepeatRepairPolicy` table (default 3 repairs / 120 days, optional category-similarity), one row per tenant with forced RLS, upserted via `GET`/`PUT /api/assets/repeat-repair-policy`; `IRepeatRepairDetector` / `GET /api/assets/{id}/repeat-repair` return the in-window count, cost and `isRepeatRepair` flag (PF-6.04 `#58`). The `RepeatRepairWarning` component surfaces it as a banner on the asset page and a compact variant on the work detail (PF-6.05 `#59`).
- **Attention** — `AttentionRules` (pure domain) evaluates seven rules over every open work item; `GET /api/attention` returns one item per work item, most-urgent-first, each carrying every finding it tripped, with per-severity distinct-work counts (PF-6.06 `#60`). The `/attention` screen shows Critical / Warning / Informational cards that each filter the list to the rows that count, every row linking to its work order (PF-6.07 `#61`).
- **Search** — `GET /api/search` behind `Work.Read`, `pg_trgm` substring + `word_similarity` over GIN trigram indexes across the tenant-scoped operations tables (PF-6.08 `#62`); the `CommandSearch` palette (`Cmd`/`Ctrl+K`, `/`, or the header button) with arrow-key navigation (PF-6.09 `#63`).
- **Integrations** — the `IIntegrationAdapter` abstraction with canonical records, a `MockIntegrationAdapter`, the `integrations` schema (`IntegrationConnection` + `ExternalRecordLink`) with forced RLS and per-record sync-state, and `/api/integrations` behind `Integrations.Manage` (PF-6.10 `#64`); the `/integrations` Health screen — per-connection status, last sync, failure count, tracked/unresolved records, Sync-now, enable/disable, an expandable per-record list (PF-6.11 `#65`).
- **Navigation** — `lib/navigation.ts` drives the header from a capability-gated list, so a role sees only usable destinations and no unbuilt surface can slip in (PF-6.12 `#66`). The same PR lifted the login rate limit to 200/min under the Development posture (Testing and Production keep 10) so the growing e2e suite is not throttled.
- **e2e** — `repeat-hvac-demo.spec.ts` walks the repeat-HVAC-repair story: asset + three costed repairs → the asset-page warning and history → the work-order warning → the `RepeatRepair` row on `/attention` (PF-6.13 `#67`).

`apps/web` has seven routes: work list, `work/[id]` detail, `assets/[id]`, `/attention`, `/integrations`, `/settings/categories` and `/settings/automation`.

Open items, all tracked in [followups.md](followups.md): the attention queue and global search are unpaged; global-search hits for building/resident/vendor/employee dead-end at a title-only work search; the repeat-repair policy has no settings screen; and integration sync tracks external records without reconciling them into the domain tables.

## 7 — Deployment and platform hardening (cross-cutting)

Close the production gaps called out in [architecture.md](architecture.md). Pull tasks forward into earlier milestones when a feature forces the issue: attachment/photo storage with tenant-scoped access control and retention (PF-7.01); multi-instance readiness — shared encrypted Data Protection keys, trusted proxy configuration, managed secrets and PostgreSQL TLS (PF-7.02); an observability pass over structured logs, end-to-end request trace IDs and basic metrics/health dashboards (PF-7.03); a scheduling model storing UTC instants plus property IANA time zones and rendering local times in web (PF-7.04); and consent, provider callback and retry/retention controls for real communication providers (PF-7.05).

Delivered (all 6 tasks closed, `#68`–`#73`). The `daycdev` hardening pass (`#151`) shipped multi-instance readiness (PF-7.02), the observability pass with end-to-end trace IDs and `/health/metrics` (PF-7.03), the UTC-instant-plus-IANA scheduling model (PF-7.04), real-provider consent / signed callbacks / retry controls (PF-7.05), and the first cut of attachment storage; the `mday440` follow-up completed PF-7.01 — the field-role scope check on every attachment route, `Work.ManageAttachments` granted to the hands-on work roles and a bound Technician, the `AttachmentRetentionSweep` that enforces `retainUntil`, the work-detail attachments panel and the technician "Add photo" flow. PF-7.06 (`#73`) enforces the RLS/grants checklist in the PR template.

## 8 — CovePM Autopilot

CovePM Autopilot is the cross-suite intelligence layer over the full PMS, financial, operations,
engagement, reporting, and compliance surfaces. It adds evidence-backed daily briefs,
recommendations, read-only questions, feedback, and governed action execution. The detailed epic
and task breakdown is [Epic M8 in backlog.md](backlog.md#epic-m8--cove-pm-autopilot).

M8 does not replace the existing event-triggered automation engine, grant an AI model direct data
or mutation access, or assume native/offline mobile delivery. The first slice is deterministic
findings plus a responsive review experience; later slices add provider-backed explanation and
explicitly governed actions with capability, approval, consent, idempotency, and audit controls.

## 9 — Native Field Apps

M9 delivers installable iOS and Android apps through the Apple App Store and Google Play for
technicians and explicitly authorized field roles. The native apps focus on assigned work, offline
property context, status and note updates, photo capture, inspections, queued synchronization,
conflict recovery, and field notifications. They do not replace the manager/admin web workspace or
recreate the full PMS.

The detailed epic and task breakdown is [Epic M9 in backlog.md](backlog.md#epic-m9--native-field-apps).
M9 requires a native client and production store/release work; a responsive web app, PWA, or browser
wrapper does not satisfy the milestone. Offline data remains tenant- and assignment-scoped, and
every queued mutation must be idempotent, auditable, retryable, and explicit about conflicts.

## Full-suite expansion (FS) — gates 1-5

Milestones 1-7 delivered the **Operations/Maintenance release**. The remaining product surface is
scoped in [full-suite-scope.md](full-suite-scope.md) and tracked under `FS-` ids; the gate-to-
milestone-to-slice map, with every GitHub issue number, is in
[backlog.md](backlog.md) under *Full-suite expansion (FS)*.

Each of gates 1-4 is split into two GitHub milestones — an `A` platform track and a `B` workflow
track — so `FS-G1A`/`FS-G1B`, `FS-G2A`/`FS-G2B` and their siblings are **milestones, not
issues**.

**Gate 1 — Core PMS foundation (partially implemented).** `FS-G1B` (Core PMS workflows) is
delivered: portfolio/property management with archive state, contacts and documents (`FS-S02`);
marketing, listings, availability, showings and applicants (`FS-S04`); leases, renewals, notices,
parties, documents and charges (`FS-S06`); and the resident portal with announcements, household
members and resident payments (`FS-S07`). It landed as the single branch `feat/fs-gate1-core`
because the fourteen migrations interleave across the four slices and share one hand-written
security migration, `20260911160000_FS_S04S06TenantSecurity.cs`. `FS-G1A` — identity/organizations/
permissions/audit (`FS-S01` `#189`) and configuration/workflow administration (`FS-S03` `#191`) —
is **not delivered**: the board marks `FS-S01` *In progress*, but nothing for it is on `develop`,
and `FS-S03` is still `Backlog`.

Gates 2-5 are not started. Their acceptance criteria are the per-gate test lists in
[full-suite-scope.md](full-suite-scope.md) -> *Release gates*.

Each milestone must build and pass its relevant checks. Do not implement the full product in one pass.
