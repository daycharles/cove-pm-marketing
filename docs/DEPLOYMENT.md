# PropFlow — install and run

This is the complete guide for installing PropFlow on one machine and signing in. It is also the
`README.md` inside every release bundle.

For running from source while changing code (`dotnet run`, `next dev`), see
[RELEASE-TESTING.md](https://github.com/daycharles/PropFlow/blob/main/docs/RELEASE-TESTING.md) instead — **the credentials in that document are for that
path only and will not work with a bundle installed from here.**

---

## Sign-in credentials

The form at <http://127.0.0.1:3000> asks for **three** fields. The organization slug is the one
people miss — it is not optional, and an email and password alone will not get you in.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Organization slug** | `averion-demo` |
| **Email** | `demo-admin@averion.example.test` |
| **Password** | `CoveDemo!2026` |

Two more accounts are seeded, with the same password:

| Slug | Email | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `averion-demo` | `demo-technician@averion.example.test` | A **Technician**. Deliberately sees only work assigned to them — a shorter list here is the access model working, not a fault. |
| `isolation-demo` | `demo-admin@isolation.example.test` | A **separate organization** with its own small dataset, for checking tenant isolation. |

These are also written to `SIGN-IN.txt` in the state directory (section 7) every time the stack
starts, and `./propflow-deploy credentials` reprints them at any time.

To choose your own password, set `PROPFLOW_DEMO_PASSWORD` **before the first `up`** — it must be
12+ characters with upper case, lower case, a digit and punctuation. After the first run the
accounts exist and changing the variable does nothing.

## 1. What you need first

| Requirement | Why | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Docker Desktop**, running | PostgreSQL 17 runs in a container | `docker info` prints a server version |
| **Node.js 22** | The web app is a Next.js server | `node --version` |
| Ports **5432**, **5001**, **3000** free | Database, API, web app | see below |

You do **not** need the .NET SDK, a checkout, or `git`. The API, admin tool and deployer are
self-contained builds carrying their own runtime.

A Homebrew PostgreSQL is the usual cause of a busy 5432:

```bash
brew services list              # look for postgresql@NN  started
brew services stop postgresql@16
```

On Windows, check a port with `netstat -ano | findstr :5432`.

---

## 2. Install

### macOS

```bash
tar xzf propflow-1.0.0-rc.3-osx-arm64.tar.gz      # Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
# or
tar xzf propflow-1.0.0-rc.3-osx-x64.tar.gz        # Intel Mac

cd propflow-1.0.0-rc.3-osx-arm64
```

**Unpack with `tar`, not by double-clicking in Finder.** `tar` preserves the executable bit;
Archive Utility does not, and you will get `permission denied`.

macOS may also quarantine a downloaded binary. If you see *"cannot be opened because the developer
cannot be verified"*, clear it once:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine .
```

### Windows

Either run **`propflow-1.0.0-rc.3-win-x64.msi`** — which installs to `C:\Program Files\PropFlow`,
adds Start Menu shortcuts, and puts `propflow-deploy` on your `PATH` — or unzip
`propflow-1.0.0-rc.3-win-x64.zip` anywhere and work inside it.

---

## 3. Start it

### macOS one-click installer

After extracting the macOS bundle, double-click `Install-Cove-PM.command` in Finder. It checks
Docker Desktop and Node.js, preserves an existing state directory when upgrading, and starts Cove
PM. If macOS asks which application should open the file, choose Terminal. Docker Desktop must be
installed and running; the installer cannot install Docker or approve its system permissions for
you.

```bash
./propflow-deploy up
```

On Windows with the MSI, use the **Start PropFlow** shortcut, or `propflow-deploy up` from any
terminal.

It prints what it is doing, in six steps:

1. **Starts PostgreSQL** and waits for its health check.
2. **Applies migrations** — four schemas: identity, operations, communications, integrations.
3. **Configures the restricted database role** the API is allowed to use.
4. **Seeds demo data** — two organizations, 100 work orders. Skip with `--no-seed`.
5. **Builds the web app** — `npm ci` then `next build`. **This is the slow step and only happens
   once**; expect a few minutes on a first run.
6. **Starts the API and web app** and waits until both answer.

Before all that it runs a preflight and, if anything is wrong, reports **every** problem at once
with a fix for each rather than failing one at a time.

When it finishes it prints the URL and the credentials. Then open **<http://127.0.0.1:3000>**.

`up` is safe to re-run: it reuses the credentials, certificate and web build it made the first
time, so a second start takes seconds.

### The other commands

```bash
./propflow-deploy status          # ports, API health, where state lives
./propflow-deploy credentials     # reprint the sign-in accounts
./propflow-deploy down            # stop everything, keep the data
./propflow-deploy down --reset    # stop and drop the database
./propflow-deploy up --no-seed    # start with no demo data
./propflow-deploy --help
```

## 4. What to look at

[demo-script.md](https://github.com/daycharles/PropFlow/blob/main/docs/demo-script.md) is the ordered walkthrough, about six minutes. It **leads with
bulk vendor assignment** — the headline feature.

The short version, signed in as `averion-demo` / `demo-admin@averion.example.test`:

1. **Bulk vendor assignment.** Filter **Status → New**, tick the header checkbox, **Assign vendor
   only** → pick a vendor → **Confirm**. Open one of those work orders and see `VendorAssigned` on
   its timeline. This is the thing to see first.
2. **Assign & notify** — the same selection with a visit window and a resident message, with a
   per-step summary.
3. **Filters and saved views** — filter, sort, save the view, reload, reapply.
4. **The timeline** — append-only, enforced at three levels; it cannot be edited or deleted.
5. **Tenant isolation** — sign out, sign in as `isolation-demo`, confirm none of Averion's data
   is visible.
6. **Technician "on the way"** — sign in as the technician account, open assigned work, mark on
   the way.
7. **Automation rules** — `/settings/automation`. Create a WHEN/IF/THEN rule, trigger it.
8. **Asset detail and repeat-repair** — an asset's maintenance history and roll-ups, with the
   repeat-repair warning where it applies.
9. **Attention queue** — `/attention`, with Critical / Warning / Informational cards.
10. **Global search** — `Cmd+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K`.
11. **Integration health** — `/integrations`. The adapter is a mock.
12. **Attachments** — upload a PDF or photo on a work order, ≤ 25 MB.

### Re-running the demo

The demo **consumes its own data**: bulk assignment moves every `New` item to `Assigned`, so a
second run finds nothing to assign. The seeders are idempotent *by skip*, so re-running `up` does
not restore it. For a clean dataset:

```bash
./propflow-deploy down --reset
./propflow-deploy up
```

The seed is deterministic, so every reset produces exactly the same data.

## 5. If something goes wrong

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| **Login is rejected** | The organization slug is required — `averion-demo`, not blank. Check the password with `./propflow-deploy credentials`; do not use the one in `RELEASE-TESTING.md`, which is for the from-source path. |
| **Login says too many attempts** | Production rate-limits sign-in to 10/minute. Wait a minute. |
| **The page will not load** | The stack is not running. `./propflow-deploy status`, then `up`. |
| **Technician sees very little work** | Working as designed: a Technician is scoped to work assigned to them. Use the admin account for the full list. |
| `cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified` | Gatekeeper quarantine. `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine .` |
| `permission denied: ./propflow-deploy` | Unpacked in Finder instead of with `tar`. `chmod +x propflow-deploy api/PropFlow.Api admin/PropFlow.Admin` |
| Preflight: Docker not responding | Docker Desktop is not started, or still starting. |
| Preflight: port 5432 in use | A local PostgreSQL. `brew services stop postgresql@NN` |
| Preflight: port 3000 or 5001 in use | A previous deployment. `./propflow-deploy down` |
| `/health/ready` never leaves 503 | Migrations or the runtime role did not apply. Read `logs/api.log` in the state directory. |
| The web app never becomes ready | Read `logs/web.log`. A failed `npm ci` — usually no network to the npm registry — is the common cause. |
| Nothing left to bulk-assign | The demo consumed the `New` items. `down --reset` then `up`. |

An **absent** log file is not a clean log — it means the process never started. The deployer says
which of the two happened rather than printing nothing.

---

## 6. What "production posture" means here

The API runs with `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production`, which this codebase treats as a real mode
rather than a label. It *refuses to start* without three things, all supplied by the deployer:

| Enforced | Where |
| --- | --- |
| A persistent Data Protection key ring | `src/PropFlow.Api/Program.cs:58-62` |
| An explicit forwarded-headers trust boundary | `src/PropFlow.Api/DeploymentConfiguration.cs:40-43` |
| A configured attachment root | `src/PropFlow.Infrastructure/Attachments/LocalAttachmentStorage.cs:52-54` |

Also real: the restricted database role (the API refuses an owner/superuser connection), row-level
security `ENABLE` **and** `FORCE` on every business table, the production login rate limit, and
the full security header set. The web app is `next build` + `next start`, not a dev server.

**You will not see a `Strict-Transport-Security` header, and that is correct.** `UseHsts()` is
registered outside Development but is called without options, so ASP.NET's default excluded-hosts
list suppresses it on `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `[::1]`. A deployment on a real hostname gets
it. The other five headers are present.

### Two deliberate deviations

Both are what a real deployment would replace:

1. **TLS is terminated by Kestrel** with a self-signed certificate the deployer issues
   (`CN=localhost`, one year), not by an ingress with a CA-issued one. Nothing is added to your OS
   trust store: the only process that must trust it is Node, which is given the PEM through
   `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, and your browser never talks to the API directly — it reaches the web
   app over `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, a potentially-trustworthy origin, so the `Secure` / `__Host-`
   cookies the API sets through the proxy are still accepted.
2. **The forwarded-headers allow-list is loopback**, because there is no proxy in front. The
   setting is required in Production and so is supplied, but it is not doing real work here.

**Messaging is the mock outbox.** Resident messages are recorded and appear on the timeline;
nothing is delivered to a real phone or inbox.

---

## 7. Where everything lives

Everything the deployment creates sits in one state directory. Deleting it is a factory reset.

| Where it is | When |
| --- | --- |
| `state/` next to the executable | You unpacked an archive |
| `%ProgramData%\PropFlow` | Windows, installed by the MSI |
| `~/Library/Application Support/PropFlow` | macOS, if the app directory is not writable |

`./propflow-deploy status` prints the actual path. Override it with `--state <path>` or
`PROPFLOW_STATE`.

```
SIGN-IN.txt              the accounts above, written on every start
deployment.json          generated credentials (0600 on Unix)
certs/                   propflow.pfx (Kestrel) and propflow.pem (Node)
dataprotection-keys/     the key ring protecting auth and antiforgery cookies
attachments/             attachment blobs
logs/api.log             API output
logs/web.log             web app output
processes.json           pids, so `down` can stop what `up` started
web/                     the web build, when the app directory is read-only
```

The database passwords are generated per install — 32 characters each, and the runtime role is
rejected below 20. The demo account password is the documented one above, because a person has to
type it.

This is **not** a secret-management story. A real deployment takes these from a secret manager
(PF-7.02). `deployment.json` is a plain file; treat the directory as you would any credential
store.

## 8. Building the bundles yourself

From a checkout, with the .NET SDK:

```powershell
./scripts/Publish-Deployment.ps1                                          # macOS, both architectures
./scripts/Publish-Deployment.ps1 -RuntimeIdentifier win-x64 -Installer    # Windows zip + MSI
```

Output lands in `artifacts/` (gitignored). Three things the script handles that are easy to get
wrong by hand:

- **Lock files.** A self-contained restore appends a per-RID section (`"net10.0/osx-arm64": {}`)
  to every committed `packages.lock.json`. `RestorePackagesWithLockFile=false` is not an escape —
  NuGet rejects it with **NU1005** when a lock file exists. So the script refuses to start if any
  lock file is already dirty, and reverts them in a `finally` — on failure as well as success,
  because a half-finished publish is exactly what leaves them dirty for the next run.
- **The executable bit.** Windows filesystems have none, so an archive built there unpacks with
  `propflow-deploy` non-executable. The script uses **GNU tar**'s `--mode=a+rx`. Windows' bundled
  `tar` is bsdtar and rejects `--mode`; Git for Windows ships GNU tar, located by deriving it from
  wherever `git` itself is installed. GNU tar on Windows also needs `--force-local`, or `C:\...`
  is read as a remote host, and its own directory on `PATH` so `--gzip` can find `gzip`.
- **The MSI** needs the WiX CLI: `dotnet tool install --global wix`. Windows bundles are zipped
  rather than tarred — Explorer opens zip natively and there is no execute bit to preserve.

Verify a built archive with `tar -tvzf …`; the binaries should read `-rwxr-xr-x`.
