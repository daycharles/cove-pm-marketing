/**
 * PF-S05.09 — the corrected applicant flow on /marketing/listings, end to end.
 *
 * What this guards is the thing the old panel got wrong: it had one click from "applicant" to
 * "Approved", with no consent and no decision row. So the assertions that matter here are the
 * negative ones — "Send to screening" is DISABLED while the application is only Submitted, and
 * the reason is on screen — not merely that the happy path reaches Approved.
 *
 * The verdict is not asserted. ConfiguredScreeningProvider derives Pass/Review/Fail from a stable
 * hash of the idempotency key (Screening/ConfiguredScreeningProvider.cs), so which one this
 * application draws depends on ids generated at run time. The spec therefore fills BOTH the
 * reason and the note before approving, which is valid for every verdict — and is exactly what a
 * Fail would require. Forcing a verdict means setting `Screening:ProviderMode`, which is a stack
 * configuration change and belongs to the integration suite, not to a browser spec.
 *
 * The provider-outage path (503, nothing written, rendered as a retryable transient) is likewise
 * not reachable from a browser without `Screening:ProviderMode=Unavailable` on the API process.
 * It is covered by the panel's own 503 branch and by PF-S05.06's tests.
